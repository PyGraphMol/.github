# Contributing to GraphMol

We welcome contributions that uphold our commitment to **principled design** and **architectural excellence**. Every addition should strengthen the unified ecosystem while maintaining mathematical elegance.

## Philosophy

GraphMol exists to create a **mathematical edifice** for computational molecular science. We prioritize:

- **Architectural purity** over expedient solutions
- **Long-term elegance** over short-term convenience  
- **Principled composition** over pragmatic workarounds
- **Performance by design** over retrofitted optimization

If you share this vision of computational tools that reflect the inherent beauty of molecular systems, we'd love your contribution.

## Types of Contributions

### Core Framework Enhancements
Improvements to the foundational architecture, performance optimizations, and essential capabilities in the main `graphmol` package.

**Standards**: Highest architectural rigor. Must strengthen overall system design.

**Standards**: Must follow established architectural patterns and maintain interface consistency.

### Community Packages
Independent packages that integrate with GraphMol while maintaining architectural compatibility.

**Standards**: Must respect core design principles and provide clear value to the ecosystem.

### Documentation and Examples
Technical documentation, tutorials, examples, and educational content that helps users understand and apply GraphMol effectively.

**Standards**: Must be accurate, clear, and reflect current architectural patterns.

## Architectural Guidelines

### Layered Architecture Compliance
All contributions must respect the [architectural layers](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md):

```
Infrastructure → Computation → Theory → Knowledge → Protocols → Implementations → Facades
```

**Rules**:
- Components may only depend on lower layers
- No circular dependencies allowed
- Each layer has a single, focused responsibility
- Cross-layer communication follows established patterns

### Interface Design Principles

**"One Way, Many Options"**: Each abstraction should expose exactly one canonical interface with behavioral variations through configuration.

```python
# ✅ Canonical interface with configuration
engine = SimulationEngine.create(config)
result = engine.run(system)

# ❌ Multiple methods for similar operations  
engine = SimulationEngine()
result = engine.run_md(system) or engine.run_mc(system)
```

**Configuration-Driven Complexity**: Rich behaviors emerge through structured configuration, not interface proliferation.

```python
# ✅ Configuration-driven behavior
config = OptimizationConfig(
    method="genetic_algorithm",
    population_size=100,
    parallel_strategy="gpu"
)

# ❌ Specialized subclasses
optimizer = GeneticAlgorithmOptimizer(population_size=100)
```

### Performance Standards

**Performance by Design**: Optimization must be architectural, not retrofitted.

- Use vectorized operations through NumPy/SciPy
- Design for automatic parallelization
- Consider memory layout and cache efficiency
- Profile critical paths and optimize algorithmically

**Benchmarking Required**: Performance-critical contributions must include benchmarks demonstrating:
- Computational complexity characteristics
- Memory usage patterns
- Scaling behavior with input size
- Comparison with existing approaches

## Code Quality Standards

### Mathematical Elegance
Code structure should reflect the logical structure of the problem domain with aesthetic coherence.

**Clean Abstractions**: Each component should represent a beautiful simplification of complexity.

**Geometric Harmony**: Similar concepts should be expressed through similar patterns.

**Compositional Beauty**: Components should fit together with natural grace.

### Implementation Standards

**Type Safety**: Use Python type hints throughout. Critical paths should be statically analyzable.

**Error Handling**: Failures should be handled through principled error channels, not buried in return codes.

**Documentation**: Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and structure.

**Testing**: Focus on architectural contracts and behavioral specifications.

### Dependencies

**Framework Native**: Leverage existing capabilities in NumPy, SciPy, and the scientific Python ecosystem.

**Minimal Dependencies**: Avoid packages that duplicate core functionality.

**No Architectural Compromises**: Don't add dependencies that require architectural workarounds.
