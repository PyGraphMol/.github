# Architecture

## Design Overview

GraphMol follows a **geometric, hierarchical design** with clean separation of concerns. Each layer depends only on layers below it, creating a **mathematically elegant dependency graph** with no circular references.

## Layer Structure

```
User Interface     →  Domain-oriented tools (molecules, simulation, analysis)
Facade Layer      →  Clean mapping between user needs and implementation
Implementations   →  Concrete realizations of computational engines
Protocols         →  Interface contracts and extension points
Knowledge         →  Molecular science domain representation
Theory            →  Universal theoretical frameworks
Computation       →  Mathematical algorithms and data structures
Infrastructure    →  Foundation primitives and parallel execution
```

## Core Principles

### Graph-Centric Architecture
- **Universal molecular representation** through sophisticated graph abstractions
- **Scale-invariant design** from atoms to protein complexes to biological systems
- **Native graph algorithms** optimized for molecular data structures

### Optimized by Design
- **Parallel execution** as a first-class architectural concern
- **GPU acceleration** seamlessly integrated across all computational engines
- **Memory-efficient** data structures with intelligent caching strategies
- **Performance optimization** embedded in every layer, not bolted on

### Machine Learning Native
- **ML-first molecular representations** designed for modern neural architectures
- **Unified training pipelines** that work across different model types
- **Automatic feature engineering** from molecular graphs
- **Inference optimization** for production molecular property prediction

### Principled Foundation
- **Clean layered architecture** with mathematical precision
- **Single canonical interface** for each abstraction
- **Configuration-driven complexity** enabling rich behavior without interface proliferation
- **Zero architectural compromises** - every design decision serves long-term elegance

## Architectural Patterns

### Dual Interface Design
GraphMol provides both **user-friendly external interfaces** and **principled internal architecture**:

- **External Interface**: Domain-oriented modules that match user mental models
- **Internal Architecture**: Mathematically rigorous layered structure
- **Facade Mapping**: Clean separation between usability and implementation

### Selective Dependencies
Components only depend on layers they actually need:
- **Infrastructure**: Required by everything for basic technical services
- **Computation**: Only for components doing mathematical operations
- **Theory**: Only for physics-based modeling
- **Knowledge**: Required for domain-specific work

### Extension Points
- **Horizontal Extensions**: New capabilities within existing layers
- **Vertical Extensions**: Domain-specific modules spanning multiple layers
- **Plugin Architecture**: Runtime discovery and loading of extensions
